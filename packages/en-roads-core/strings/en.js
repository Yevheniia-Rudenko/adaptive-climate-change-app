Plankton, the tiny organisms that drift through the sea, are the foundation of ocean ecosystems. Phytoplankton (plant-like) and zooplankton (animal-like) are essential because they provide food for many other marine creatures.</p><p>Although warmer water can speed up growth rates in marine organisms, it also increases death rates. Additionally, as the water warms, phytoplankton become smaller, meaning there is less food available for zooplankton and animals (Carozza et al., 2019).</p><p>Warming also makes the ocean more layered, or stratified, which reduces the mixing of nutrients from deeper waters into the surface where most marine life lives. This leads to less food for organisms higher up in a food chain, like fish and marine mammals. The effect of warming varies by region. Tropical areas are likely to experience significant losses in marine life, while colder, higher-latitude regions may experience increases in ocean biomass (Lotze et al., 2019).</p><p>The relationship between temperature and loss in ocean biomass is derived from Tittensor et al.

Note that the social discount rate is not the same as the discount rate a company might use to evaluate whether to undertake an investment that would require the firm to spend funds today but might increase its profit in the future. Instead, it represents the concern people alive today have for the welfare of future generations. The higher the social discount rate, the less the welfare of future generations counts.</p><p>The value of the social discount rate used in climate change studies is controversial.
